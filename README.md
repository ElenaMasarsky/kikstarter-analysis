# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project shows how different kickstarting campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

### Purpose
We are helping an up-and-coming playwright, Louise, who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign
to help fund her play, Fever. She's estimating a budget of over $ 10,000 and is hesitant about jumping
into her first fundraising campaign. We are using Excel to organize, sort, and analyze crowdfunding data to
determine whether there are specific factors that make a project's campaign successful. We use these insights
to help Louise plan her own and set it up for success. Using Excel to analyze current site data, we help her
gain a greater understanding of campaigns from start to finish, and we set her campaign to mirror other successful ones in the same
category.


## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Our analysis shows that pic of campaign comes on May and June.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals



### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
When I was working with COUNTIFS formula I wanted to ease my work by pasting my first formula to all cells I needed and then 
just change arguments. For most of the cells it worked but for some celles it gave me an error. So I had to delete them and start
from the beginning applying formulas for that particular cells manually.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. The value of canceled projects in theater/plays category tends to zero.
2. The most successful months to launch the campaign are May and June.


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
According to analysis of the pivot table and the graph the most successful outcomes show campains with goals less than $5,000. The projects with goals
between $35,000 and $50,000 also showed high percentage of success. But they are only few. So it's hard to predict outcome based on this numbers.
Louise estimated her budget of over $10,000. Probably she might consider if it's possible to reduce her budget. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
In Theater Outcomes by Launch Data analysis the difference between successful and failed campaigns is not obvios. I would add the columns showing results
in percentage to emphasize relatons between these outcomes.
This data set doesn't show us for failed campains how much in average pledged ammount did not reach the goal and how much in average pledged ammount
for successfull campaigns overreached the goal. Obviosly some campaigns were close to the goal. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
I whould add columns showing percentage of successful, failed and canceled campaigns into the Outcomes by Launch Date pivot table.
